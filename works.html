        <h3>This is my project 2.</h3>
        <p>This is a nursery rhyme book with 16 pages. And it is the final project for Publishing 231. This project combinated text and images to create a nursery rhyme book. It asked to examine the expressive of typography and shapes, and understood the connection between meaning with shapes and typographic forms, and graphic elements and typography. And also, this project explored the ideas of sequencing and carrying a narrative within a multi-page format. </p>

        <h3>My role in this project.</h3>
        <p>This is an individual project. The nursery rhyme I chose the "I am a little groundhog". In this project, I used the images to text to express each part of selected nursery rhyme.</p>

        <h3>Challenge & Solution</h3>
        <p>The difficulty of this project is to use a suitable shape to present the content of the nursery rhyme. In this project, I combine the different design elements, such as points, lines, forms, textures, and colors, to express the narrative. The main character, groundhog, composes of an irregular circle, hair and a pair of teeth. I zoom in the teeth. Because I think it is the symbol of the groundhog. For unity, all elements are put in an irregular circle. There are some design details for the content.</p>
