              <h3>Project Description</h3>
              <p>The project, I am going to show, is a 16 pages graphic comic book. It is a project of my publishing course. It describes a nursery rhyme "I'm a Little Groundhog". This nursery rhyme teaches children about the story of Groundhog Day. As a popular tradition celebrated by Canada and the United States, it mainly said that the groundhog will come out of its burrow on February 2nd. If it sees its shadow, it will return to burrow, and then winter will continue for six weeks. Opposite, the spring would come soon.</p>

              <h3>What Did I Do?</h3>
              <p>The project was a graphic comic book, which came from my publishing course. It combined text and images to create a nursery rhyme book. The project asked to examine the expressive of typography and shapes and to understand the connection between meaning with shapes and typographic forms. And also, to explore the ideas of sequencing and carrying a narrative within a multipage format. This is the front coverFigure 7 of "I Am A Little Groundhog". The idea comes from the symbolic items of the groundhog. When I thought groundhog, my first impression is its white and big teeth for me. For increasing this impression, I amplification its teeth. And also using the black and white contrast to emphasize this impression.</p>

              <h3>Challenge & Solution</h3>
              <p>To determine the book's audience is the one of the challanges when I worked. There was a existing age gap between children and me, which was hard for me to stand at the perspective of a child of 3 - 6 years old to view this project. Thus, I took some time to research and observate audiences. I foud that for 3 - 6 year olds too many attractive points would distract them. To let them focus on the contents of the book, I used a small amount of color and simple shapes to express content. Additionally, considering that the characteristics of the audiences, I avoided to express the complexity of the scene. I made elements round and lovely, and also used bright pictures.<br>
                I use the principle of <strong>monochrome color</strong> as the main color of the book. It consists of three shades of dark, medium and bright, which goal is to create a clearer and more focused visual representation for target audiences. According to the principle of Bang(2016), the audience's emotions were influenced by shape and color. Thus, I choose brown, derived from the skin color of the groundhog. The goal isto make audiences understand the connection between character and real groundhog. <br>
                The target audiences of this book is children aged 3 - 6. Consider reading and visual habit in this age, I used <strong>Comic Sans MS</strong> as major typographic. The familiar and easygoing feeling it demonstrates, which fits my positioning of the target audience. I believe the round and cute font shape will appeal to children to read.

              <p>This is the final project of IAT235 course. This project created a website that could show a communicating complexity with a clear manner. The main issue was trying to clear up for stakeholders involves some kind of human-technical-environmental 'thing', like system, process, phenomenon, institution, etc.. In this project, we focused on how the Three Gorges Dam influenced building Local residences’ life and living condition.
