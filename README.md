# P03

Starting October 31
1. Working in-lab as a starting point, create a style guide that defines the visual portion of your ethos — the understanding, characteristics, and definition of yourself in your portfolio. This style guide should help visually define you in the role your portoflio presents: a programmer, game developer, illustrator, designer, content strategist... etc, without being clichéd or a stereotype.

2. Based on the visual ethos you are developing, complete a process analysis of two projects which help form a text to support your ethos and show how you created a project from start to finish. The text and accompanying artifacts — images, video, audio, applications, etc — must demonstrate your ability to think through a problem and iterate a project over time. Make sure to also consider how these projects speak to the abilities you are presenting as part of your ethos. Aim to use 250-300 words for each analysis.

3. Write a draft of a bio using no more than 100 words to introduce yourself. Ensure there is a meaningful connection between what you describe here and what your visual and textual ethos express.

4. Generate an initial set of HTML/CSS templates showing how the visual and textual components of your ethos would be used in your site.
